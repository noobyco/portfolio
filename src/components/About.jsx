                        Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Myself <span className="text-slate-800 font-semibold">Shekh Md Moinuddin</span> a young tech enthusiast and a final-year undergrad student in Information Science and Engineering.

                        I love diving into all things tech with a curious mind that never stops exploring. Getting my hands dirty and using kick-ass self-learning methods are my jam. Sometimes, I get so engrossed in playing with electrons that I go a bit crazy, but hey, that's the thrill of it, right? ðŸ¤ª Exploring the binary world, tinkering with bits and bytes, and firing commands is just so darn exciting!

                        And you know what else gets me hungry for more? Raspberry Pi and microcontrollers! They're like delicious treats that I can't get enough of. Trust me, they make the perfect combination, just like mayo on a sandwich. ðŸ˜‰
